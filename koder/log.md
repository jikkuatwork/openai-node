CDN Deployment Script Implementation Complete
07:12 PM, 6 January 2025

Successfully implemented automated CDN deployment script that copies bundles to CDN repository, commits, and optionally pushes changes.

## Deployment Implementation Summary

Created deploy.js script with features:
- **Automated File Copy**: Copies all bundle formats to `../cdn/libs/openai-sdk/v-{version}/`
- **Version Management**: Uses main repo's package.json version automatically  
- **Symlink Management**: Updates `v-latest` to point to new version
- **Git Integration**: Commits with descriptive messages, optional auto-push
- **Safety Features**: Confirms before overwriting, validates git repo
- **Multiple Commands**: `deploy`, `deploy:push`, `deploy:force`

Successfully tested:
- [x] Script copies all 10 bundle files (ESM, IIFE, UMD + maps)
- [x] Creates new versioned directory (v-5.1.0)
- [x] Updates v-latest symlink correctly  
- [x] Commits to CDN git repository
- [x] Preserves existing versions (v-5.0.2 still intact)
- [x] Generates correct CDN URLs for all formats

## Complete System Summary

The standalone-bundle now provides:
1. **Enhanced Build**: ESM + IIFE + UMD bundles with better DX
2. **Automated Deployment**: One-command CDN deployment 
3. **Version Sync**: Automatically uses main repo version
4. **Full Compatibility**: Works with existing setups + adds new features

Both original repo and CDN workflows are now fully automated and enhanced.

## Latest Updates

- [x] Fixed symlinks to use relative paths (v-latest -> v-5.1.0)
- [x] Updated all CDN URLs to use actual domain: cdn.toolbomber.com
- [x] Converted index.html to use ES6 imports with CDN URL
- [x] Updated README examples to use production CDN URLs
- [x] All documentation now shows real-world usage

## Next Steps

- [x] Context: Brief user on completed CDN deployment capabilities  
- [x] Permission: All tasks complete - ready for production use

Enhanced Build Script Implementation Complete
07:12 PM, 6 January 2025

Successfully implemented enhanced build script that generates multiple bundle formats for improved ES6 export/import ergonomics while maintaining full backwards compatibility.

## Implementation Summary

Enhanced build.js now generates three bundle formats:
1. **ESM Bundle** - Native ES6 imports: `import OpenAI from './openai-sdk.esm.js'`
2. **IIFE Bundle** - Legacy compatible: `const { default: OpenAI } = OpenAIBundle`  
3. **UMD Bundle** - Universal: Works in all environments

Key improvements:
- Zero-build ES6 import syntax support
- Maintains complete backwards compatibility
- Enhanced DX with native import/export ergonomics
- Multiple usage examples for each format
- Self-contained in standalone-bundle/ directory

- [x] Enhanced build.js with multi-format output
- [x] Generated ESM, IIFE, and UMD bundles
- [x] Created usage examples for each format
- [x] Updated README.md with comprehensive documentation
- [x] Tested all bundle formats successfully
- [x] Maintained backwards compatibility

## Next Steps

- [x] Context: Brief user on completed enhancements
- [x] Permission: No further tasks - implementation complete

Analysis of Current Bundle ES6 Export/Import Capabilities
07:12 PM, 6 January 2025

Started evaluation of the standalone-bundle build script to assess potential for improving ES6 export/import ergonomics. Current implementation uses IIFE format with global `OpenAIBundle` variable.

Current limitations identified:
- Bundle uses IIFE format exposing `OpenAIBundle` global
- Consumers must destructure from global: `const { default: OpenAI } = OpenAIBundle`
- No native ES6 import/export support for better DX
- Current usage requires: `<script src="bundle.js"></script>` then destructuring

- [x] Read spec.md and understanding requirements  
- [x] Read standalone-bundle README.md for context
- [x] Analyzed current build.js implementation
- [x] Examined existing index.html usage patterns
- [x] Research ES6 module approaches for IIFE bundles

## Next Steps

- [x] Context: Explain current findings to user about bundle limitations
- [x] Permission: Request permission to proceed with ES6 research and implementation
- [x] Research ES6 module export approaches for browser bundles
- [x] Design enhanced bundle with better ES6 DX
- [x] Implement and test enhanced solution
