# Spec

Refine the UI in `../standalone-bundle/index.html`

## Principles

- Its a _single_ file PWA
- Its a build free PWA

## Refinements

1. Dark Mode

- many text & input boxes still has wrong colors

2. Colors / Themes

- Avoid using different colors for tabs, use a single theme color throughout
- use `bg-neutral` themes for background

3. Settings Screen

- The settings screen is very noisy
- We need to refine it, simplify it and avoid redundant fields
- Fix alignment issues

4. NavBar

- Avoid theme switcher there, its already there in settings

5. Meta

- Name: Vanilla AI
- Description: Build free, standalone alone OpenAI SDK
