# Spec

Refine the UI in `../standalone-bundle/index.html`

## Principles

- Its a _single_ file PWA
- Its a build free PWA

## Refinements

1. Dark Mode

- many text & input boxes still has wrong colors

2. Colors / Themes

- Avoid using different colors for tabs, use a single theme color throughout
- use `bg-neutral` themes for background
- settings is still yet to change
- avoid Emojis in the app
- use feather icons

3. Settings Screen

- The settings screen is very noisy
- We need to refine it, simplify it and avoid redundant fields
- Fix alignment issues

4. NavBar

- Avoid theme switcher there, its already there in settings

5. Meta

- Name: Vanilla AI
- Change description to: `OpenAI bundle-less Standalone JS SDK`

6. PWA

- Make it PWA
